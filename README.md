# Income_Class_Prediction_Models

![alt text](image.png)
### Problem Definition
Develop a classification system that could determine whether an individual's yearly income surpassed the $50K mark or remained below that threshold. To tackle this challenge, two distinct machine learning models were chosen:

1. Random Forest Classifier: This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes' theorem and the assumption of feature independence, often effective in various classification tasks.

### Requirement Gathering
The dataset used for training and evaluating the models was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The “Census Income” dataset consists of 48842 instances, and each represented by 14 attributes. Dataset characteristics are multivariate, which has both categorical and integer Feature Types.

### Learning Outcome
1. To create a dataset for ML using data and feature engineering methods applied to a realworld data collection.
2. To use ML evaluation methodologies to compare and contrast supervised ML algorithms using an established machine learning framework

### Tasks
- To preprocess the dataset using data and feature engineering methods.
- To train the Random Forest Classification algorithm and Naïve Bayes algorithm with preprocessed data
- To evaluate machine learning algorithms using optimal evaluation techniques.
